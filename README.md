**I have uploaded 5 files to check the code out ! **

**3-axis-graph.ipynb** > this file contains code with guide inside it 

**temp.csv** > contains temprature data

**water_discharge.csv** > contains water discharge data in m^3/sec

**water_level.csv** > shows how high water level on a day

**result_3axis.png** > shows the last result 

**!!! Because of copyright, I have not shown name of river that this all data belongs**

Every time I plot I tried to use different type of line graph
